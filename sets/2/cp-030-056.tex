The total charge that has entered the happy face unit at $t=3$ seconds is 4 coulombs. The current entering the top terminal is given as $i(t)=3t+2$ Amperes. How much total charge has entered the happy face by the time $t=4$ seconds?

\begin{align*}
	q&=\int_{0}^{t}i(t)\,\mathrm{d}t & q&=\frac{3t^2}{2}+2t-15.5\\
	4&=\int_{0}^{3}3t+2\,\mathrm{d}t & q&=\frac{3(4^2)}{2}+2(4)-15.5\\
	4&=\frac{3(3^2)}{2}+2(3)+C 		 & q&=\frac{3(16)}{2}+8-15.5\\
	4&=19.5+C 						 & q&=24-7.5 \\
	C&=-15.5  						 & q&=\hlbox{16.5 C}
\end{align*}
